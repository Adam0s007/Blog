## Prerequisites

- Ensure that you have Docker installed on your machine. If not, download it from [Docker Official Page](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

## Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Adam0s007/Blog.git
   cd Blog
   ```

2. **Start Docker**

   Make sure Docker is running on your machine. Refer to Docker's official documentation if you encounter any issues.

3. **Run the Application**

   Follow the steps below to run the application:

   1. **Start the Services**:
   
      Navigate to the project directory and execute the following command:
   
      ```sh
      docker-compose up
      ```

      Wait for the last message to be:
      ```
      LOG:  database system is ready to accept connections
      ```


   2. **Inject Sample Data**:
   
      While the container is running, execute the following command to inject data from `blog_dump.sql` into the database. Replace `blog-postgres-1` with the actual name of your PostgreSQL container if itâ€™s different.
   
      ```sh
      cat blog_dump.sql | docker exec -i blog-postgres-1 psql -U postgres blog
      ```

   3. **Restart the Services**:
   
      After injecting the sample data, stop the running services using `Ctrl+C` or by executing `docker-compose down` in another terminal. Then, start the services again using:
   
      ```sh
      docker-compose up
      ```

   The application should now be up and running with the sample data from `blog_dump.sql`. 
   
   ***Note***: Make sure Docker and Docker Compose are correctly installed and configured on your system before running the above commands. Refer to the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) for installation and configuration guidelines.


4. **Access the Application**

   Once the Docker containers are up and running, open your web browser and navigate to:

   ```sh
   http://127.0.0.1:4000/
   ```

## Usage

- Register / login to start interacting with the platform.
- Once logged in, you can create, edit, or delete articles and reviews.
- Explore articles based on tags/categories or through the search functionality.
- Update your user information through the user profile section.
